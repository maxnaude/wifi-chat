Project Isizwe's WiFi-Chat
=========

Buddycloud-channels for the WiFi-Chat project

install and run:
-----------------

For ease we'll install the development packages to build our CSS and Javascript on run.

```bash
npm i --development .
```

Then we start the script it will build the assets for us:

```bash
npm start
```

If you happen to have a precompiled version then:

```bash
npm i .
node index
```

Will see you right.

Both setups will kick off a server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
